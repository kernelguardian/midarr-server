Free and open source (and always will be), **Midarr** aims to provide a tailored experience for **you** and **your**
users:

* Beautifully crafted user interface
* Real-time online statuses
* Simple and easy invite system
* Integrates with your existing services, [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) and [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/)

![Preview](misc/screenshots/home-v2.0.0.png)

### What is this?

This is a lightweight (albeit companion) media server to the likes of Radarr and Sonarr. 
Your media is left untouched and unscathed as it is served through a simple (yet familiar) web interface that puts your media front and center for
**you** and **your** users to enjoy.

While other media solutions look to re-index, re-fetch and re-double handle your media library, **Midarr** simply levarages your pre-existing
services to delight and enchant **you** and **your** users' media experience.

![Preview](misc/screenshots/ecosystem-v2.0.0.jpg)

### How is this lightweight?

* **No media indexing.** All the metadata needed is already on your server. **Midarr** never goes out looking for more, everything we need you already have.
* **No media transcoding.** Nope, none whatsoever. Your media is served fresh off the metal.
* **No media editing.** We trust you already have it the way you like it, lets keep it that way.

### What does this do?

Your media is served through a slick web interface providing:

* User authentication
* User profile settings
* User online statuses

with more features planned ahead.

## Setup

### Integrations

* Supports Radarr - `v4.1`
* Supports Sonarr - `v3.0`

On server startup **Midarr** attempts to auto configure your integrations by:

* **Caching movie and series responses.** This is for speedy access to your library
* **Adding webhook / connect endpoints.** This is for keeping your cache in sync

> __Warning__
>
> Ensure your integration environment variables are set for auto configuration to complete

```yaml
environment:
  - RADARR_BASE_URL=radarr:7878
  - RADARR_API_KEY=someApiKey

  - SONARR_BASE_URL=sonarr:8989
  - SONARR_API_KEY=someApiKey
```


### Media library

For your media locations to resolve, please provide the following **paths** as found in your integrations.

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/movies:/radarr/movies/path
  - /path/to/shows:/sonarr/shows/path
```

### Admin account

To initialise this, please provide the following **environment variables**. This will allow you to configure your server at the **settings** page.

```yaml
environment:
  - SETUP_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@email.com
  - SETUP_ADMIN_NAME=admin
  - SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=somepassword # minimum length 12
```
